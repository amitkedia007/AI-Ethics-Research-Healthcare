# AI in Healthcare: Ethical, Governance, and Regulatory Considerations

This repository contains research work focused on ethical, governance, and regulatory considerations when deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital technologies in the healthcare sector. The research covers a broad range of topics, including AI's transformative potential in radiology, the role of digital technologies in increasing patient access to care, and challenges in successfully implementing AI in healthcare.

The project scrutinizes various issues such as stakeholder resistance, privacy concerns, data accuracy, and the "black-box" nature of deep learning algorithms. It also explores the impact of telehealth strategies on rural vs urban healthcare access, AI's role in managing pandemics, and the potential privacy implications of mobile health (mHealth) technologies.

The primary goal is to critically analyze and assess the myriad ethical and governance issues that could arise when deploying digital technology, particularly in the healthcare sector.

The repository includes:

Literature Review: Detailed review of scholarly articles and research studies on the subject.
Analysis: In-depth analysis of the potential ethical and governance issues identified in the literature.
Recommendations: Proposals for policies, processes, and protocols to employ AI in a transparent, responsible, and fair manner.
This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, healthcare professionals, AI developers, and policymakers interested in the ethical and regulatory aspects of AI in healthcare.
